# Description

I got many great responses on my article about <a href="https://dev.to/yuridevat/how-to-write-a-promising-cv-32ih">How To Write A Promising CV</a> - thank you for that.

I've been asked many times which tool is the best to create a CV like mine easily and for free. So I thought, why not develop our own tool? Together, open source, as part of Hacktoberfest 2022?
